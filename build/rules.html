      <h1>Rules</h1>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>The objective of the game is to kick the ball into the oponets goal (the dark green area of the board). once a goal is scored the
        board is reset to the original configuration and becomes the turn of the team who was scored on.  The game continues until one player
        reaches three goals thus winning the game. </p>
      <h2>Game Pieces</h2>
      <p>The game contains two types of pieces Kings and Pawns.  The Pawns are the goalies of the game.  They stay within the goaile box
      (the medium green area of the board).  They have the ability to move anywhere within the box and any movement the goalie makes does not count toward
      the total moves allowed for the turn.  The Kings make up the rest of the team and can move anywhere in the white space on the board.  Each player
      can move only one square at a time, in the same fashion a King in chess can move, and each movement counts toward your move total for the turn.  Pieces are selected on the board using the mouse to click
      on the piece and then moved to the desired square by clicking on that square.</p>
      <h2>Kicking and the Ball Movement</h2>
      <p>At any point a game pice can kick the ball if it is any of the adjacent 8 squares next to the game pice.  The player can select
      the ball by first selecting the game peice to kick with then selecting the ball.  Finally the game piece kicks the ball by selecting
      any of the adjacent 8 squares next to the game piece.  Once the ball is kicked it will begin to travel from the kick loaction following the trajectory
      of the line between the game piece and ball.  The ball will travel until it hits either another game piece or the wall </p>
      <h2>Game Flow</h2>
      <p>The game is divided into turns starting with white first.  A turn consist of some combination of 3 kicks and 3 moves.  A turn ends
       when a player has depleated either allotment. Rounds consist of the turns it takes for one team to score a goal when one team scores the round
       is over and to board is reset to its inital condition.  Counters at the top of the board display how many moves and kicks a player has left
       in a particular turn</p>
